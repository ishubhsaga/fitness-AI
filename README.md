# 🏋️ Fitness AI – Personalized Fitness & Nutrition Platform (HTML Only)

Fitness AI is a simple, beginner-friendly web project built using HTML only, designed to demonstrate how AI-driven logic can be integrated into fitness coaching. The platform focuses on personalized workouts and nutrition plans based on user inputs such as height, weight, goals, and dietary preferences.

This project is ideal for learning frontend structure, form handling concepts, and AI-ready UI design.

🚀 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to remove confusion from fitness by creating a structured web interface where users can:

Understand the importance of fitness

Learn about the trainer behind the platform

Enter personal body details

Receive AI-generated workout programs

Get nutrition and macro guidance based on diet preference

⚠️ Note: This project focuses on HTML structure and UI. AI logic can be integrated later using JavaScript or backend technologies.

🧠 Concept Behind Fitness AI

Most people fail at fitness not because they lack motivation, but because they lack clarity and personalization.

Fitness AI is built on these principles:

Every body is different

One-size-fits-all plans don’t work

Consistency beats perfection

Technology should support coaching, not replace it

This project demonstrates how AI can be used as a support system to guide users with structured, personalized recommendations.
