            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>My fitness journey didn't start with a perfect plan or a perfect body. It started with frustration—feeling uncomfortable in my own skin, lacking confidence, and not knowing which advice to trust.</p>
            
            <p>Like most people, I tried random workouts, followed popular routines, and jumped between diets. Some things worked for a while, most didn't. What finally changed everything was understanding one simple truth: fitness only works when it's built around the individual.</p>
            
            <p>I started learning—about training, nutrition, recovery, and how different bodies respond differently. Through consistency, discipline, and countless small improvements, fitness became more than a goal. It became a lifestyle and a mindset.</p>
            
            <p>Over time, I realized something important: people don't fail at fitness because they're lazy—they fail because they're confused. Too much information, too many contradictions, and no personalization.</p>
            
            <p>That's why I built this platform.</p>
            
            <p>By combining real-world fitness experience with AI-driven logic, I aim to remove confusion and replace it with clarity. Every plan here is designed around your body, your goals, and your lifestyle—not someone else's.</p>
            
            <p>Whether you're trying to lose fat, build muscle, or simply feel stronger and more confident, my role is to guide you with structure, honesty, and consistency.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about quick transformations.<br>It's about building a body—and a mindset—you can sustain for life.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Show up. Stay consistent. Results will follow.</strong></p>

            <h3>My Philosophy</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Fitness is not one-size-fits-all</li>
                <li>Consistency beats perfection</li>
                <li>Every body is different and deserves personalized attention</li>
                <li>Technology enhances human coaching, not replaces it</li>
                <li>Building healthy habits is the ultimate goal</li>
            </ul>
